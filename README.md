# Car-Evaluation
Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target
   concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts:
   PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model
   related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for
   these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).

   The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural
   information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input
   attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

   Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be
   particularly useful for testing constructive induction and
   structure discovery methods.
